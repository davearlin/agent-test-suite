# Quick Test Feature - Dialogflow Agent Testing

## Overview

The Quick Test feature allows you to instantly test prompts against your Dialogflow CX agents directly from the web interface. This feature provides a convenient way to validate agent responses, test conversation flows, and debug agent behavior without needing to use the Dialogflow Console.

**Latest Enhancement (Oct 2024)**: Complete Dialogflow CX Playbooks support alongside traditional flows, plus multi-regional architecture support for testing agents across all Google Cloud regions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load agents" error**
   - Check Google Cloud authentication and OAuth token validity
   - Verify user has proper IAM permissions for Dialogflow CX
   - Ensure Dialogflow CX API is enabled for the selected project
   - Check if agents exist in any of the supported regions

2. **"Agent not found in any location" error**
   - Verify the agent exists and is accessible
   - Check if the agent is in a region not currently supported
   - Ensure proper IAM permissions for the agent's region
   - Try refreshing the agent list after checking permissions

3. **"Mock response" displayed**
   - This indicates Dialogflow credentials are not properly configured
   - Verify OAuth authentication is working
   - Check if the user has proper Google Cloud access
   - Ensure the project has Dialogflow CX API enabled

4. **No flows or pages loading**
   - Ensure the agent has flows configured in the Dialogflow Console
   - Check agent permissions for the specific region
   - Verify the agent ID is correct and the agent is accessible
   - Check if the regional client is properly configured for the agent's location

5. **"QueryParameters error" messages**
   - This has been resolved in the latest version (Sept 12, 2025)
   - Ensure you're using the updated backend with the QueryParameters fix
   - If still occurring, check the agent's Dialogflow CX API version compatibility

6. **Slow response times**
   - Normal for first request (cold start) especially for regional clients
   - Subsequent requests should be faster with regional client caching
   - Check network connectivity to the specific Google Cloud region
   - Consider agent region proximity for optimal performance

7. **Cross-regional functionality issues**
   - Ensure all regional endpoints are accessible from your network
   - Check if your organization has any firewall restrictions for Google Cloud regions
   - Verify the agent's region supports the specific Dialogflow CX features being used
   - Try testing with agents in different regions to isolate region-specific issues

### Regional Architecture Debug

**Supported Regions**: global, us-central1, us-east1, us-west1, europe-west1, asia-northeast1

**Regional Client Endpoints**:
- **Global**: Default Dialogflow endpoint
- **Regional**: {location}-dialogflow.googleapis.com

**Troubleshooting Regional Issues**:
1. Check backend logs for regional client creation errors
2. Verify the agent's location is correctly detected
3. Ensure the regional endpoint is accessible
4. Test with agents in different regions to isolate issues

### Debug Mode
When Dialogflow credentials are not available, the system operates in mock mode:
- Returns simulated responses for testing UI functionality
- Allows development and testing without GCP setup
- Clearly indicates mock responses in the UI
- **Regional Mock Support**: Simulates responses for agents in different regions

This enhanced Quick Test feature with multi-regional architecture significantly improves the development and testing workflow for Dialogflow agents across all Google Cloud regions, providing immediate feedback and detailed insights into agent behavior regardless of their geographic location.

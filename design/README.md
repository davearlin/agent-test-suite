- Use them to understand data flow and component relationships
- Consult during code reviews and architectural decisions

### **For DevOps/Infrastructure:**
- Use deployment diagrams for environment setup
- Reference monitoring diagrams for observability implementation
- Follow security patterns outlined in configuration management

### **For AI Agents/Copilot:**
- These diagrams provide comprehensive context for the application
- Use them to understand the complete system when making code changes
- Reference specific flows when debugging or enhancing features

## ðŸ”„ **Viewing Mermaid Diagrams**

### **In VS Code:**
1. Install the "Mermaid Preview" extension
2. Open any `.md` file in this folder
3. Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Mermaid Preview: Open Preview"

### **In GitHub:**
- GitHub natively renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files
- View directly in the repository browser

### **Online Tools:**
- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
- Copy diagram code and paste for editing/viewing

## ðŸ”„ **Recent Architecture Updates (September 2025)**

### **Preference System Bug Fixes (September 26, 2025)**
Critical stability improvements to user preference management:
- **Race Condition Resolution**: Fixed timing dependency issues in dropdown loading by eliminating conflicting API calls
- **State Management Consistency**: Standardized immediate save pattern across QuickTest and CreateTestRun pages
- **Session Persistence**: Fixed Session ID field not saving empty values properly on QuickTest page
- **Duplicate API Prevention**: Removed conflicting useEffect hooks that caused duplicate preference PUT calls
- **Model Restoration Logic**: Fixed LLM Model preferences not restoring when Playbook is selected
- **Code Quality**: Removed all debug console.log statements while preserving essential error handling

### **Preference Persistence System**
Recent work has enhanced the user experience system with:
- **User Model Extensions**: Added `test_run_batch_size` column to User model with automated migrations
- **Timing Architecture**: Implemented `initialLoadingComplete` flags to prevent race conditions in preference loading
- **API Enhancements**: Enhanced `auth.py` endpoints with structured logging and null value handling
- **Frontend State Management**: Refined useEffect dependency management to prevent infinite loops

### **Dialogflow Service Layer**
- **Flows API Improvements**: Modified `dialogflow_service.py` to use agent names instead of ID extraction
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed 500 errors in flows endpoint that were causing UI failures

### **Debugging Infrastructure**
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive console logging system for tracking preference lifecycle
- **Developer Tools**: Added distinctive log messages for debugging timing and persistence issues

## ðŸ”„ **Keeping Diagrams Updated**

When making significant architectural changes:
1. Update relevant diagrams in this folder
2. Ensure consistency across all documentation
3. Update version references and dates
4. Commit diagram changes with code changes
